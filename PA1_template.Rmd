## Loading and preprocessing the data
if(!file.exists('activity.csv')){
    unzip('activity.zip')
}
activityData <- read.csv('activity.csv')


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

stepsByDay <- tapply(activityData$steps, activityData$date, sum, na.rm=TRUE)

## Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

qplot(stepsByDay, xlab='Total steps per day', ylab='Frequency using binwith 500', binwidth=500)

## Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day

stepsByDayMean <- mean(stepsByDay)
stepsByDayMedian <- median(stepsByDay)

Mean: 9354.23
Median: 10395

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

averageStepsPerTimeBlock <- aggregate(x=list(meanSteps=activityData$steps), by=list(interval=activityData$interval), FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)

1. Make a time series plot

ggplot(data=averageStepsPerTimeBlock, aes(x=interval, y=meanSteps)) +
    geom_line() +
    xlab("5-minute interval") +
    ylab("average number of steps taken") 

2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

mostSteps <- which.max(averageStepsPerTimeBlock$meanSteps)
timeMostSteps <-  gsub("([0-9]{1,2})([0-9]{2})", "\\1:\\2", averageStepsPerTimeBlock[mostSteps,'interval'])

Most Steps at: 8:35

## Imputing missing values

1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset

numMissingValues <- length(which(is.na(activityData$steps)))
Number of missing values: 2304

2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset.

3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

activityDataImputed <- activityData
activityDataImputed$steps <- impute(activityData$steps, fun=mean)
4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

stepsByDayImputed <- tapply(activityDataImputed$steps, activityDataImputed$date, sum)
qplot(stepsByDayImputed, xlab='Total steps per day (Imputed)', ylab='Frequency using binwith 500', binwidth=500)

... and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.

stepsByDayMeanImputed <- mean(stepsByDayImputed)
stepsByDayMedianImputed <- median(stepsByDayImputed)
Mean (Imputed): 1.0766 × 104
Median (Imputed): 1.0766 × 104


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
